I like making things.

Some possibly interesting repos:
* [mqtteer: report various device metrics to Home Assistant](https://github.com/odrling/mqtteer)
* [peony-twitter: async client for the Twitter API](https://github.com/odrling/peony-twitter)
* [hikari: a file host](https://codeberg.org/odrling/hikari)
* [my gentoo overlay](https://codeberg.org/odrling/odrling-overlay)
* [my dotfiles](https://github.com/odrling/dotfiles)

I have some public repositories in other places:  
[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/odrling) when I feel like it's the better place.  
[git.odrling.xyz](https://git.odrling.xyz/) for world domination projects, sometimes they end up on Github or Codeberg, at which point they definitely aren't world domination projects.
